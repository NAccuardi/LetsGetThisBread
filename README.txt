Within the GitHub link, there exists 3 different directories:

1.) ./datasets
- contains all csv and Excel files that contain our data (the most important file being "workingData.xslx", which is the file that we create a dataframe out of in our R code for our Shiny website application.

2.) ./rstudio
- this contains R code for when we were creating analytical models from our workingData-dataframe. 
- The sub-directory called "bigDataBread" consists of our initial work on a dataset that consisted of about 100 different grocery stores in the Multnomah County.
- The sub-directory called "moreWorkingData" consists of our further work on the "workingData" dataframe that consisted of over 300 different grocery stores in the Portland, Vancouver, and Seattle Metro areas. We used a lot of code from this sub-directory in our Shiny web app.

3.) ./ShinyBread
- This is where our "app.R" file exists in order to run our Shiny website application.
- Our Shiny application consists of all the relevant data visualizations and data analysis reflections for our project (once it is opened on local machine via RStudio).
